# Starquess
Starquess is an open source e-learning platform that was initially developed in December 2022. The platform has since undergone numerous updates and improvements, but we are now making the original version available as open source software.

# Getting Started
To get started, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```git clone https://github.com/starquess/old-version.git```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the project directory and use the following command:
```php -S localhost:8000```

This will start the server on port 8000. You can then access the platform by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
